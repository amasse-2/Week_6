## [Project 4:](https://github.com/amasse-2/Week_6/blob/main/project_4.java)
- An implemented program that reads a list of integers from the scanned input and saves it to a Linked List and is sorted from smallest to largest.
- Version: 1.0
- Last Edited: Week 4 of CSC6301
  
#### Methods:
  ```public static LinkedList<Integer> sort_list(LinkedList<Integer> nums)```
  - the **sort_list** method returns a sorted version of the linked list provided to the method. Using the Bubble Sort Algorithm, the linked list is sorted from smallest to largest.

#### Test Run:

## [Project 5:](https://github.com/amasse-2/Week_6/blob/main/project_5.java)
- An implemented program that reads a list of integers numbers from the scanned input and saves it to a Stack (instead of a linked list) and is sorted from smallest to largest.
- Version 2.0
- Last Edited: Week 5 of CSC6301
  
#### Methods:
  ```public static Stack<Integer> sort_stack(Stack<Integer> nums)```
  -  the **sort_stack** method returns a sorted version of the stack provided to the method. Using the Bubble Sort Algorithm, the stack is sorted from smallest to largest. Renamed sort stack as implementation has changed from Linked List to Stack.
